* This is a radio station that continuously play BMS and bmson music. Basically, this is rhythm games music. For more information, see [this Angolmois docs](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/angolmois/wiki/What-is-BMS%3F) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guv1vRAKanY).
* I run this station using spare resources on my server to discover more BMS songs. This channel will always be free and without ads as long as I run it.
* All songs are converted from BMS or bmson files using [bms2mp3](https://github.com/bemusic/bms2mp3), using the same engine used in [Bemuse](https://bemuse.ninja/).
* This radio station is hosted by flicknote. You can reach me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bemusegame).
* You may be interested in joining [BMS chat on Discord](https://discord.gg/0lUN07Rj1O8zv5Y5).
* If you want your song removed from the stream, please contact flicknoteâ˜†spacet.me or ping flicknote on Discord.
* Web design and color scheme blatantly stolen from [LR2IR](http://www.dream-pro.info/~lavalse/LR2IR/search.cgi).
* Be-Music Surge is not affiliated in any way with surge.sh. By the way, [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) is a very cool static web host!
