[Be-Music Surge](http://be-music.surge.sh)’s website.

Most of Be-Music Surge’s infrastructure has been changed.
Most of the code now lives in the [bmsurge-renderer](https://github.com/bemusic/bmsurge-renderer) repository.

For old code, check out the [old](https://github.com/bemusic/bmsurge/tree/old) branch.
